Task 2:   Analysis 

    Analyze the worst-case run-time complexity of the member function clear() of Stack.

    The worst-case run-time complexity of a SIMPLE clear() function,
    which would just be O(n) because each pop() would just be O(1). 
    This assumes a constant time pop(), which mine is not. However, if 
    I shifted the resizing checks into a resize() function, pop()
    would be constant, meaning that clear() would be linear because it 
    increases in time complexity linearly as more elements are added.
